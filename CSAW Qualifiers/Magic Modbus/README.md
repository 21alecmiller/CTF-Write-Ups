CSAW Writeup: The Magic Modbus (ICS)

Description: Climb on the Magic Modbus and see if you can find some of the messages being passed around!

So this one starts pretty straightforward, you get a .pcap file and you need to find a message hidden in the packets. After some research, it looks like Modbus is a communication protocol based on queries and responses. 

Looking at the pcap in wireshark, it looks like this is exactly what we have, a bunch of queries and responses, from a couple different ip addresses. Given we're looking for hidden messages, I guessed that it would probably be sent through the response packets, which are sending answers back to the addresses sending the queries.

So that's an example of one of the response packets. In wireshark, I filtered out the query packets, to just look at the responses. Paging through the packets, they all look pretty similar, with one exception, the last line "Register _ (UINT16): ___". 

So those numbers are probably significant. Keep paging through, turns out the numbers never go above 125â€¦ looks like ascii. I threw the first 10 numbers into an ascii -> converter, no luck. Looks like gibberish, but it looks like ascii alright, so let's try rearranging some (first try was time forward). 

After a bit of trial and error with sorting the packets, I get this from sorting by Source: OK, Bus, do. Looks promising, so I just keep copying all the numbers into the converter. Scripting this would probably be better, but this worked too. Note for the future, look for the { (123) to save yourself some typing. But this is what we get, and there's the flag!
